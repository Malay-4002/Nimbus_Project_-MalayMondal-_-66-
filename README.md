🧭 Introduction

This is our group's PPS project where we made College Admission Management System.

This project simulates that real admission process using fundamental C programming concepts.


📌 Project Overview

The College Admission Management System is a C-based program designed to simulate the real-world admission process followed by educational institutions. It collects 

applicant details, generates a merit list using reservation rules, allocates seats to preferred courses, and stores admission data using file handling.

This project demonstrates strong use of arrays, functions, structures, pointers, loops, file I/O, and decision-making statements.

🎯 Objectives

⭐To manage applicant details efficiently

⭐To calculate merit scores using reservation criteria

⭐To generate a sorted merit list

⭐To allocate seats based on availability

⭐To store and retrieve records using files

⭐To apply core C programming concepts in a real-world scenario

🧩 Key Features


✔ 1. Applicant Data Entry

Takes:

Name

Marks (0–100)

Category (GEN / OBC / SC / ST)

Preferred Course

✔ 2. Merit Score Generation

Bonus marks based on category:

OBC → +2

SC → +4

ST → +5

✔ 3. Merit List Sorting

Applicants sorted in descending order using bubble sort.

✔ 4. Seat Allocation Module

Each course has a fixed number of seats.
Applicants are allocated seats according to merit score and course availability.

✔ 5. File Handling

Saves all applicant records to admissions.txt

Loads records back into the program
